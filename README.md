# Senior Project

Dungeons and Dragons Character Manager

This project is my senior project completed for Wilmington University in pursuit of my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science.

## Installation 

The project can be ran either with the .sln file and the "DnDEntityLibrary" and "GuiApplication" folders, which contain all the code for the project, or with all the files from the "Application-Files" to run it as an executable. 

The main executable file, "GuiApplication.exe", needs to be manually downloaded due to the file size. The TestData1.xml and TestData2.xml files contain example data for a quicker start with the application, but can be omitted if not needed.

## Usage

On the startup page of the application, a file must be selected to begin. If there are no available files, a new file can be created. 

After selecting a file and selecting a campaign, group or all entries, the entries page will display. If there are no entries, a new entry must be created using the "New Entry" button. 

Selecting an entry leads to the single entry page, where information about the entry can be editted. Adding campaigns or groups will add the entry to an existing grouping or create a new one, depending on if the entered name already exists.

Items and Spells must be manually added to the respective lists, upon which they will be available for viewing on the expanded entry list in the entries page.

Saving changes to files can be done manually with the save button on the entries page or when prompted while closing the application. Note, files emptied of entries during use may be deleted upon saving.
